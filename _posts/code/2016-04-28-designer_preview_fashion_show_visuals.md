This was one of the most satisfying projects I got to work on while at Nordstrom. For 
the 2015 Designer Preview we were tasked with creating background visuals for the event's runway 
show. We were given the agonizingly open ended theme of "Punk Rock meets Expressionism." Ultimately, 
this theme wound up being too vague to be useful and the project became an exercise in creating 
as many cool visuals as we could in the hopes that our client would like a few. 

As much of a grind as this project was at times, it was extremely satisfying to push the limits of 
what I thought I was capable of doing in Processing and to play with shaders in that environment. 
Thankfully, over time we whipped up a few visuals that stuck and with the help of Nordstrom's video team
we were able to deliver visuals that everyone was satisfied with.
