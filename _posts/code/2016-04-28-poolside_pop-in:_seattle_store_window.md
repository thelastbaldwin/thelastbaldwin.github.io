This was a really satisfying project to work on. Once again, the Emerging Media team was tasked 
with creating a cool display on Nordstrom's LED display. The theme of the Pop-In was 'Poolside', so
we decided to do something water themed. This display used a kinect to follow the hands of passersby. 
When users would move their hands around, ripples would appear in the display simulating waves in a 
pool. This project was created using OpenFrameworks.
