Every year, in late July, Nordstrom hosts the Fall Preview Fashion Show. 
This year we were asked to create some interactive Pop Art 'paintings' that were a 
tribute to three of the most prolific artists in the movement, Warhol, Lichtenstein and 
Rosenquist. Each interactive 'painting' uses a standard webcam as input, allowing viewers 
to impact the content of the painting by standing in front of it and observing it.
