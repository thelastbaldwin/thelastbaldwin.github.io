For this project, we created a set of three animated gift boxes, adding visual interest to the 
2014 Holiday Pop-In shop. The hash symbols spin and the parallaxing effect were achieved with simple
CSS animations. The animating triangles were created using ThreeJS. A shader generates the striped 
pattern and this shader material is applied to a series of triangles stacked over one another.
