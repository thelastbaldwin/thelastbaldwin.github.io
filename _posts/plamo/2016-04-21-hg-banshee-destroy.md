This was a very satisfying build. This was a previously
built kit by my friend [@pazrul](https://twitter.com/pazrul). First,
I soaked the kit in simple green for several days to help remove any stickers 
and paint completely.

Next, I primed the kit using Mr Surfacer 1200. After that, I painted most of the 
body using tamiya acrylics. I used german gray and black for most of the kit, and a 
custom 70% gray for the joints and a few accents. I also painted in the insides 
of the thrusters and the eyes red.

The gold was painted with Testors Gold. This super cheap paint leaves a surprisingly 
brilliant finish, but I didn't consider how this would adversely affect applying washes. 
I applied a coat of Pledge "Future" Shine over the enamel paint, but my lighter fluid and enamel
wash ate through the parts I tried to wash almost instantly and I would up having to repaint them. 
Because of this, the gold parts don't have a wash applied.

I applied some third party decals from ebay to this model. I've had mixed results with cheap decals,
but a smooth finish mixed with decal setting and softening solutions worked very well. 


The most tedious part of this build was achieving the mixed finishes. Because I didn't 
plan out the placement of the decals I wound up reassembling the entire kit 3 times. The final
product is pretty stellar, though. The gold pieces have a vivid shine and the rest of the body pieces
have a matte finish that gives a pleasant contrast.
