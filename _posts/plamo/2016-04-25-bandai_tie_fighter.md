This was my first Bandai Star Wars kit and I have to say, Bandai really upped their game
for this franchise. Gundam kits are fun to build partially because the quality of the kits' 
engineering. The edges and details are sharply molded and parts fit with admirable accuracy.
The Bandai Star Wars line feels like a step up from even that. The proportions of the kit itself
are basically perfect, but the small bumps and surface details of the kit bring the kit to life. 
Some of the most interesting areas of the kit are the insides and outsides of the solar panels, which 
have a hypnotizing amount of detail.
