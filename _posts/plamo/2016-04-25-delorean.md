This was an interesting build because I'd never built a car model before!
The process was completely different from building a spaceship or a gundam. On one 
hand the part count was dramatically lower than a typical gundam, but on the other hand
basically every part had to be complete before it was glued in place. The toughest parts of the
build were the bundles of wires that run around the outside of the body and around the inside on the 
dash. In retrospect, I gained a lot of confidence with a small brush while painting them but it was 
extremely tedious in the moment.
