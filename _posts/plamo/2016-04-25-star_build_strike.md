This build took a very long time. I purchased the Universe Booster along with the 
Build Strike Full Package to build this guy. I added an SMD LED into the head and 
wired it up to a custom battery pack that lives in the cockpit area in the chest. 
I tried my best to accent every visible detail on the kit. The waterslide decals are
cheap Chinese decals from eBay which gave me zero issues. This kit marks the first time
I was successful painting the pilot figure and I actually get more enjoyment from 
looking at little Sei than I do the full kit. This kit won first place in the 
1/100 Gundam category at the 2016 IPMS Spring Show.
