Oh man do I regret getting rid of this guy! The Zeta is my favorite Gundam after the Mk-II and 
painting this kit was a labor of love. Real Grade kits have almost the same number of parts as
their Master Grade counterparts but many of the pieces are miniscule and difficult to keep track of.
 I chose the color scheme because, looking at my shelf of completed kits, I realized I didn't have 
 anything that was orange. Even though this kit looked amazing, it was very fragile because it 
 transforms into a jet. I was always afraid of reposing it so it stayed like this from the moment
 I finished it. Eventually I felt like it was holding me back from more ambitious builds, so this guy 
 was mailed to an apprciative builder through Reddit.
