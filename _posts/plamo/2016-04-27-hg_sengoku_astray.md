It's been a while since I've finished this build. I was between kits and this was an impulse buy
from my local model shop. There are a lot of really cool details on this kit that make unique. 
First, there are those wacky katana that rest on the tops of the shoulders. These two
pieces have a decent amount of detail, but were molded entirely in white. These and the thrusters
on the auxilliary arms gave me a chance to practice with chrome paints and do a little hand painting.

Next, the inset green areas
were a fun challenge to paint. I painted the green before the red and white and carefully masked off
the recess with sticky tack. If you look carefully you can see a little overspray on the left knee. 
Since this was an impulse buy, I rushed this dude and finished in 4 days.

The last two interesting details were the faceplate and the legs. I wasn't very confident with my hand
painting skills at this point, so I actually masked the gold area off so I could spray it. The legs had 
an incredibly bad seam running down the middle of the thighs. I fused the seam and had to mask off all the 
red areas. It felt a little tedious at the time, but I credit this build for helping me get over masking.

At the end of the day, this was a satisfying build but a rush job that always made me feel like I 
could do better whenever I looked at it. Because space at my apartment is at a premium, this guy was
trashed a couple months after I finished him to make room for more building.
