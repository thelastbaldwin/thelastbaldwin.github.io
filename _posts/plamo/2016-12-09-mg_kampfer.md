This was a fun kit to work on, but a bit of an ordeal at the same time. My friend [Brandon](http://www.brandonpaez.com/)
who takes photos of my kits picked up this guy at a convention. It's his favorite kit and I was excited to repay 
him for all the great photos he's taken for me over the years. The LED mod was fairly straightforward and I put a ton 
of time into getting the weapons as good as I could, but things went south when I got going on the candy coat. 
Long story short, I attempted to strip some parts that didn't come out so well with lacquer thinner from the hardware store
which basically melted them beyond repair. Suddenly, I had to buy a whole other kit just to replace those parts. Once I got the 
replacement kit, I was much more careful and the results speak for themselves.
