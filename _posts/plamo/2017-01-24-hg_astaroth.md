The Astaroth is my easily my favorite kit design in the past year 
and quickly becoming one of my favorite suits, period. The designs in 
Iron-Blooded Orphans feel like grittier versions of the suits from 00
and the assymetrical treatment of the Astaroth pushes that aesthetic in 
an even more interesting direction. 

I accomplished the rivets on this kit by countersinking sewing pins into
the body of the figure. I've seen this done on [gundamguy](http://gundamguy.blogspot.com)
on several custom builds and was pleased that it was both effective and easy.
